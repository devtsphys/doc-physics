## Mechanics of a particle

The general trajectory of a classical partical in the three-dimensional space is given by

$$
\vec x(t)=(x(t),y(t),z(t))^T=
$$

where the coordinate functions $x\equiv x(t)$ depend on the time variable $t\in\mathbb R$.

We define the velocity of a classical particle as the derivative with respect to the time variable

$$
\vec v(t)=\dot{\vec x}(t)=\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm dt}\vec x(t)=(\dot x(t),\dot y(t),\dot z(t))^T
$$

The acceleration of a classical particle is given by

$$
\vec a(t)=\dot{\vec v}(t)=\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm dt}\vec v(t)=(\ddot x(t),\ddot y(t),\ddot z(t))^T
$$
